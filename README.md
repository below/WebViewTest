# WebViewTest
This is a sample to demonstrate a webview issue

## The issue

When selecting text in this sample, the view does not scroll when the selection drag reaches the screen, i.e. you can only select what is visible.

If the WKWebView is on it's own, or even when there is no bottom element (and thus no fixed size for the webView), this works
